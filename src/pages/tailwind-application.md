</div>

I am Maxi, a developer from Spain living in Sweden. I am writing to express my willingness to join your club to share experiences and tips about living in cold conditions. I understand that some of you are from Canada, so I am looking forward to learning from you.

All joking aside, I am applying for the Staff Software Engineer role because I think I am a great candidate for it. My hunger for creating beautiful products and my thirst for learning drive me to constantly innovate and refine products that I am proud to stand behind. I am excited about the Tailwind CSS project and look forward to contributing to it.

---

## What can I offer you?

With me at your side, you will continue to deliver high quality solutions, making sure every single block of code is perfect. As a team, we will keep building products that exceed our users' expectations, whether that means working on the Tailwind CSS codebase, creating great developer tools, or interacting with people and other teams on GitHub to make our code better. Whatever the users need, I am here to serve them.

I am obsessive, I like everything polished and purposeful. I am always looking for ways to improve the codebase to make it more performant and maintainable. That's why I like to learn and seek for new challenges. I want to push the boundaries of technology and create something that makes developers' lives easier.

I want everything to be perfect, but I don't want to get stuck, so I'm always repeating this quote in my mind:

> _Perfection_ is a moving target, and the pursuit of it brings you closer and closer.

That's where I find the beauty. The balance between achieving perfection, making progress and learning from the journey. 

The products built at Tailwind Labs empower developers to build amazing projects that have a huge impact on the world. I want to be part of the small team that is shaping the future of web development.

## How did I get here?

I'm 25 years old and have 11 years of work experience. I like the feeling of being able to rely on myself. I have worked in many different fields, from tutoring children, to working as a leisure animator, to volunteering at events like TedX. It was at one of these events that I discovered programming.

Coding opened up a whole new world for me. Whether it was building a game, designing a website or creating a program to help others, the ability to create something incredible on my own was immensely satisfying. Over time, my passion for web development solidified, largely influenced by your book _Refactoring UI_. The book was not just a resource; it was a source of inspiration and guidance for which I am deeply grateful.

This passion led me to pursue a degree in Computer Engineering. At the time, I took the opportunity to explore other fascinating areas such as low-level programming and machine learning. The latter was the subject of [my final year project](https://oa.upm.es/66259/), for which I received a distinction in early 2021.

My university experience also taught me the power of teamwork and the benefits of being part of a group where learning from others is a constant opportunity. Ever since this epiphany, I've been committed to working alongside the most talented people; striving to absorb as much knowledge from them as possible in order to develop into the best version of myself.

After graduating and feeling dissatisfied with my job at the time, I decided to leave Spain in search of new opportunities in a diverse, multicultural environment. This leap of faith led me to Germany, where I joined Nimiq. Here, I am fortunate to work with a team of exceptionally talented individuals on tasks that are both challenging and fulfilling.

During this time, I gained a deep appreciation for the principles of open source, and the simplicity and composability that are essential for building fast and efficient software. This is where my admiration for Tailwind CSS and Vue comes from. 

And that's how I got here. Still interested? Let me tell you more about my skills.

## Vue

Before joining Nimiq, I had some experience with Angular and Svelte. Having worked with Vue for the last two years, I can say that it is the crown jewel and I have mastered it. However, I understand the underlying principles of front-end frameworks, so I'm not afraid to learn React, which is where the money is. I am open to mastering React in the same way that I have mastered Vue and Angular. I don't think it will take me long to fully understand the differences between signals/refs to `useState` or `useMemo`.

One of the first projects I worked on at Nimiq was the [Nimiq Wallet](https://nimiq.com/wallet): a web-based wallet that allows you to connect directly to the network without intermediaries. This app is Nimiq's main ship, so everything we do has to be tailored to perfection. Communication between all developers is key to ensure that we are all rowing in the same direction. An example of this work is the [PR to introduce tours to the wallet](https://github.com/nimiq/wallet/pull/76), a feature that never saw the light of day, but a clear example of how I like to do pull requests. The code is two years old, but I am still very proud of it. Another project I was involved in was the integration of USDC into the Nimiq Wallet. It was a great learning experience where I was mostly involved in the logic of the frontend, but I decided to dive deeper to understand the whole picture. I then wrote about it on the [Nimiq Blog](https://www.nimiq.com/blog/a-look-into-nimiq-wallets-integration-of-usdc-through/).

Recently, I was chosen to lead the effort to refactor our new Nimiq Pay app. After a small team developed a proof of concept that showed a promising opportunity, we concluded that a structural rewrite was needed. With a team of 3 people, we spent two months deconstructing and rebuilding the app from the ground up. Although the project was challenging, careful planning and segmenting the codebase into manageable chunks helped us succeed. I can now confidently say that new features are being developed on a robust architecture, improving the maintainability and scalability of the application. I was responsible for defining the architecture, reviewing the code, and ensuring that every developer was on the same page. Unfortunately, it's not possible to share the code at this time.

I'm currently nearing completion of the [Nimiq Developer Center](https://github.com/onmax/nimiq-developer-center), a comprehensive resource hub for developers who want to create projects using Nimiq. In this project I am responsible for leading the efforts to create a useful documentation site, some of my tasks are discussing and refining the designs with the designers, planning the content with the writers, and tracking the progress of the other developers to make sure everything is on track. The site is built using Vitepress.

## Open source

During the development process of the [Nimiq Developer Center](https://github.com/onmax/nimiq-developer-center), I noticed that we often lack standardised CSS libraries on Nimiq, which leads to frequent code duplication. To address this, I've released [two new libraries](https://github.com/onmax/nimiq-ui) tailored to the Nimiq design system to improve our development workflow and give more resources to our developer community. I've detailed the process of creating these libraries in my blog: [Nimiq CSS todo change name]() and [Nimiq Icons]().

This two libraries will be also a perfect fit for the [Crypto Map](https://map.nimiq.com), an interactive app where users can explore places where they can spend their crypto. I am the lead engineer, making sure that all of the features work as expected and that the app is as performant as possible. This includes not only the frontend but also the backend. The backend is made with Supabase and many of the functions are written in Postgres Functions. The map is a living entity where every weeks there are updates about new places. That's why we developed a bot in Slack that works as an dashboard to manage the data. All the code is open source and can be found in the [Crypto Map Repo](https://github.com/nimiq/crypto-map).

While developing the map, I face many challenges in creating an UI that was both performant and easy to use. And knowing the high popularity of Radix UI, I decided to create a Vue version of it. Fortunately, I found other developers with the same goals as me, and together we made the [Vue port of Radix UI](https://radix-vue.com/) a reality. Today, I am proud to say that this package has a great acceptance in the Vue ecosystem and has been a success. However, the development was quite fast and some parts of the were written without much thought, which means that the code is not as clean as I would like. You can review how I implemented the [Accordion component](https://github.com/radix-vue/radix-vue/pull/211) as an example.

Luckily for you, I have learned a lot about building headless libraries. I can bring some of those ideas to Headless UI. We can create a full-featured library with all the components that developers need, with the high quality that Tailwind Labs is known for. And, of course, making sure that the components are accessible, fast and easy to use.

Since I have been using open source libraries, I have tried to make valuable contributions whenever I see an opportunity, whether it be implementing new features, fixing bugs, or creating plugins. For example, in the past I have created [TailwindCSS Labeled Groups](https://github.com/onmax/tailwindcss-labeled-groups) and [TailwindCSS Write Variables](https://github.com/onmax/tailwindcss-write-variables). Two features that have been added to Tailwind over time. 

## Staying sharp 

I like to keep up with the latest technologies and trends. I like to try and do fun little projects to explore these technologies. For example, a few years ago I explored Go by creating [`go-alatria`](https://github.com/onmax/go-alastria), a port of the Alastria specification. I love exploring and learning new ways of solving problems, and these kinds of projects are perfect for that. Over the years I have also tried Rust, C, Java or Haskell, but I have to say that I keep coming back to TypeScript. It's where I feel most comfortable.

These days I am more interested in web animations. I have always found them intimidating, but at the same time fascinated by the way animations can bring a website to life and make it more engaging. I am experimenting with creating animations using SVGs and CSS, while learning the principles of animation and how to apply them to web development.

## In my free time

You might have the impression that I am workaholic. And you are right. I am. But, I try to balance it with other activities. I like to spend my free time with my girlfriend cooking or playing board games. I also like padel, going out with my bike, and going for walks. Simple life? Huh?

I love the outdoors and the peace of nature. That was one of the reasons why we moved to a small farm outside Lund, where my girlfriend is doing her PhD.

Apart from programming, I am very interested in geopolitics and self-improvement. But strangely enough, my ultimate dream is to become a househusband and take care of my kids, which it is a problem because my girlfriend has the same dream.

## Wrapping it up

I know that the stakes are high and that you are about to make a big, stressful bet on someone. I hope that everything I have told you makes you feel that I am the right person for the job. I am confident that I can bring a lot of value to the team, even if I am not the most experienced developer. But I can tell you this:

1. I will make sure that every single detail is polished. 
2. I look forward to challenges and working in pairs.
3. I am a quick learner and open to feedback.

And most importantly, I will have a lot of fun.
